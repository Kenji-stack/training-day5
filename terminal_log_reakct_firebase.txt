You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\platypus2000jp\my-firebase-functions

√ Are you ready to proceed? Yes

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,

√ Please select an option: Use an existing project
√ Select a default Firebase project for this directory: smile-calendar-system (Smile-Calendar-System)

=== Firestore Setup
i  firestore: ensuring required API firestore.googleapis.com is enabled...
!  firestore: missing required API firestore.googleapis.com. Enabling now...
√ Please select the location of your Firestore database: asia-northeast1

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

√ What file should be used for Firestore Rules?

Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

√ What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json
+  Wrote firestore.rules
+  Wrote firestore.indexes.json

+  Wrote configuration info to firebase.json
+  Wrote project information to .firebaserc
+  Wrote .gitignore

+  Firebase initialization complete!

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

√ Are you ready to proceed? Yes

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,

i  Using project smile-calendar-system (Smile-Calendar-System) .

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

√ What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
√ Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
+  Wrote functions/package.json
+  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
+  Wrote functions/index.js
+  Wrote functions/.gitignore
√ Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
